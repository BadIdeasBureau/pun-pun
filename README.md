## PunPun

This module is completely pointless.  It depends on [Foundry Tips](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tips), and adds 100 puns to the list of possible tips.

Use this if you want to add some silliness into your game.

Feel free to suggest other puns in the issues - but keep things broadly PG-13, and avoid too many real-world or obscure references.  Not everything will be added, mostly dependent on my own whims.

Possible arachnophobia warning in the issues for this, due to possible fallout from one of the puns.

I'm not taking translations for this (or puns in languages other than English), since I can't vet them for content - feel free to make your own module for that.
